What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

When you resize the screen to less the 550px the screen changes to suit the screen of a mobile device. This can be done using media queries. Media queries detect the size of the users screen and display a specific output that suits each device. On mobile the display may designed to be scrolled through like a social media feer or text and buttons may appear big to aid ease of use and navigation. A desktop user might be presented a lot more information, with a newspaperish layout.
